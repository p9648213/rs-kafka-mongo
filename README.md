Rust API with Authentication, Product CRUD, MongoDB, Kafka, and Swagger UI

This project is a simple yet complete API built in Rust, demonstrating user authentication and full CRUD operations for products. It integrates MongoDB for persistent storage and uses Kafka to stream product-related events. The entire application is containerized with Docker for easy deployment, and Swagger UI is included to provide a clear and interactive interface for testing the API endpoints.

Key Features:
  - User registration and login with secure authentication
  - CRUD operations for product management
  - MongoDB integration for data persistence
  - Kafka-based event streaming for product updates
  - Swagger UI for API documentation and testing
  - Dockerized setup for consistent deployment
